# Ansible Collection - dandyrow.stow

This collection is for the stow module which allows Ansible to interact with the GNU stow symlink manager.

I decided to create this module as I wanted to automate the deployment of my dotfiles on Linux systems and they are organised into packages which can be installed using GNU stow. Dotfiles repo can be found [here](https://github.com/dandyrow/dotfiles) if you're interested.

Documentation for this module is hosted on GitHub Pages and is available [here](https://dandyrow.github.io/ansible-collection-stow/).

You can find the Ansible Galaxy page for this collection [here](https://galaxy.ansible.com/dandyrow/stow).
